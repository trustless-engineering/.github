# Don't trust the robots.

> Trustless Engineering is a Corner Store on Mars Foundation project.

Trust is inheriently a human construct. Because humans possess the ability to change their output even when presented with the same input.
We combat this flaw with trust. Trust is built between humans, generally speaking, through a function of time. No matter how much time nor how much trust has been created,
every single interaction will provide less than 100% *confidence* in the outcome.

It is in this unknown variability that the trust lives. It's a necessary component in a modern society (and sleeping well at night), but this courtesy ***SHOULD NOT*** extend to technology systems.

Computers don't have this flaw. Given the same inputs, the outputs will always be identical. 
The hard part is usually accounting for all the variables and making sure they are fundamentally understood.

Our mission is to advance the knowledge of trustless engineering practices and architecture through open-source software and community education initiatves.
