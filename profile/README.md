# Don't trust the robots.

> Trustless Engineering is a Corner Store on Mars Foundation project.

Trust is inheriently a human construct. Humans possess the ability to change their output even when presented with the same input.
Society attempts to combat this flaw with trust. Regardless of the quantity of trust that has been created,
every single interaction will provide less than 100% *confidence* in the outcome.

It is in this unknown variability that the trust lives. It's a necessary component in a modern society (and sleeping well at night), but this courtesy ***SHOULD NOT*** extend to technology systems.

Well engineered systems do not require trust. Given the same inputs, the outputs will always be identical. 
The hardest part is accounting for all the variables and ensuring they are fundamentally understood.

Our mission is to advance the knowledge of trustless engineering practices and architecture through open-source software and community education initiatves.
